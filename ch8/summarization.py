    "animals that he could bring rain if they each brought him a gift. Every animal "
    "gave something: the elephant offered fruit, the lion gave meat, and the bird "
    "brought seeds. The tortoise collected the gifts but never performed the ritual. "
    "Eventually, the sky rumbled, not with rainâ€”but with thunder of the angry animals "
    "who had been deceived."
